# Image Recognition with CIFAR-10-Dataset
CIFAR-10 ML Models

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. 
This project demonstrates the training, evaluation, and comparison of different models on this dataset. Implemented using tensorflow via Keras APIs in python.

# Models Included
1. Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Visual Geometry Group (VGG Arch)
3. Residual Network (ResNet Arch)
4. GoogLeNet
